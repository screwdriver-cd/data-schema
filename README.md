> Internal data schema of [Screwdriver](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/screwdriver)

## Description

This contains the structure/validation for all the models/resources of Screwdriver.

It's broken down into five (5) sections:
 - `api` - API related input/output structure
 - `config` - Screwdriver.yaml definitions
 - `models` - Internal data resources (pipeline, job, build, collection etc.)
 - `plugins` - Plugins (datastore, executor, etc.)
 - `core` - SCM plugin related output structure

## Models

The model represents a combination of what is required to create the resource and what is possible for returning from the resource.

### Methodology

Each model contains eight (8) schemas:
 - `base` - List of all available fields in the model
 - `allKeys` - List of all fields in the model
 - `get` - Expected return values from a GET request against this resource
 - `create` - Expected input values when making a CREATE action against this resource
 - `update` - Expected input values when making an UPDATE action against this resource
 - `keys` - List of keys that combine to represent a unique row
 - `tableName` - Internal name of the table
 - `indexes` - Secondary indexes to make search/lookup faster
