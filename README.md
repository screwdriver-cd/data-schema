> Internal data schema of [Screwdriver](https://github.com/screwdriver-cd/screwdriver)

## Description

This contains the structure/validation for all the models/resources of Screwdriver.

It's broken down into five (5) sections:
 - `api` - API related input/output structure
 - `config` - Screwdriver.yaml definitions
 - `models` - Internal data resources (pipeline, job, build, collection etc.)
 - `plugins` - Plugins (datastore, executor, etc.)
 - `core` - SCM plugin related output structure

## Models

The model represents a combination of what is required to create the resource and what is possible for returning from the resource.

### Methodology

Each model contains eight (8) schemas:
 - `base` - List of all available fields in the model
 - `allKeys` - List of all fields in the model
 - `get` - Expected return values from a GET request against this resource
 - `create` - Expected input values when making a CREATE action against this resource
 - `update` - Expected input values when making an UPDATE action against this resource
 - `keys` - List of keys that combine to represent a unique row
 - `tableName` - Internal name of the table
 - `indexes` - Secondary indexes to make search/lookup faster

## Migrations
Sequelize-cli migrations keep track of changes to the database, will help to get to a new state and revert the changes in order to get back to the old or desired state. Ensure models and migration files are in sync. Create new migration files for any new DDL changes. Do not update or delete migration files, once its migrated and available in the  database.

2. https://github.com/sequelize/cli/tree/master

CAUTION: Create migrations user (sd_migrator) in DB and this user should be given restrictive privileges to perform DDL operations. Be careful when reverting migrations, as this may end up in table getting DELETED if the user has PRIVILEGES.

### Existing Screwdriver instance
Create a new table SequelizeMeta in the existing screwdriver database. Insert a record (name column matching filename) into the SequelizeMeta table for each 20190919-initdb- file under the migrations folder. This will ensure migrations will not run for these files. After insert, verify the SequelizeMeta table has 16 records.

```bash
    CREATE TABLE public."SequelizeMeta" (
        name character varying(255) NOT NULL,
        updated timestamp without time zone DEFAULT now(),
        CONSTRAINT "SequelizeMeta_pkey" PRIMARY KEY (name)
    )

    INSERT INTO public."SequelizeMeta"(name) VALUES ('20190919-initdb-banners.js');
```

### New Screwdriver instance
To track migrations timestamp, create new table SequelizeMeta as below in existing screwdriver database; otherwise sequelize-cli will automatically create SequelizeMeta without 'updated' column.

```bash
    CREATE TABLE public."SequelizeMeta" (
        name character varying(255) NOT NULL,
        updated timestamp without time zone DEFAULT now(),
        CONSTRAINT "SequelizeMeta_pkey" PRIMARY KEY (name)
    )
```

### Environment variables 

```bash
postgres - postgres://user:password@host:port/db
mysql - mysql://user:password@host:post/db
sqlite - sqlite:/dir/file.db

DEV_DATASTORE_SEQUELIZE_URL => dialect://username:password@devhost:port/database_name
TEST_DATASTORE_SEQUELIZE_URL => dialect://username:password@testhost:port/database_name
DATASTORE_SEQUELIZE_URL => dialect://username:password@prodhost:port/database_name
DATASTORE_SEQUELIZE_PREFIX => if table names need to be prefixed (ex: 'beta-')
```

### Usage
```bash
postgres: npm install npx pg sequelize sequelize-cli 
mysql: npm install npx mysql2 sequelize sequelize-cli 
sqlite3: npm install npx sqlite3 sequelize sequelize-cli 

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate --env=development --config=./config/migrationsConfig.js --migrations-path=./migrations

npx sequelize-cli db:migrate:undo --env=development --config=./config/migrationsConfig.js --migrations-path=./migrations
``` 

## Usage

```bash
npm install screwdriver-data-schema
```

## Testing
