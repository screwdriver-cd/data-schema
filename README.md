> Internal data schema of Screwdriver

## Description

This contains the structure/validation for all the models/resources of Screwdriver.

The model represents a combination of what is required to create the resource and what is possible
for returning from the resource.

## Methodology

`platform, pipeline, job, build` contains four (4) schemas:
 - `base` - List of all available fields in the model
 - `get` - Expected return values from a GET request against this resource
 - `create` - Expected input values when making a CREATE action against this resource
 - `update` - Expected input values when making an UPDATE action against this resource

 `datastore` contains:
 - `get` - Expected values to pass in for the get method
 - `update` - Expected values to pass in for the update method
 - `save` - Expected values to pass in for the save method
 - `remove` - Expected values to pass in for the remove method
 - `scan` - Expected values to pass in for the scan method
